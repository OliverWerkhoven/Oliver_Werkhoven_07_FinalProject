Bass and treble clefs are the two types of music staffs
Musical instruments use these staffs as a way
Using only one type of musical staff for songs can be mundane, but also coordinating both staffs can help balance the music
Treble clef covers higher frequencies while bass covers low frequencies, so playing them together can give a balance of pitch and volume.
We are using MATLAB to isolate these to change the pitch of the audio.
In our project, this means taking audio data, changing the volumes of certain frequencies, and then replacing the previous audio data
We used Beethovenâ€™s 5th Symphony as a target and observed what happened to the music if we amplified the bass and treble clef frequencies
Our motivation for this project is because
we like playing music
This can help distinguish between different sound frequencies
We can visualize how both treble and bass frequencies complement each other
Music can sound cooler when it is bass-boosted or altered
